# Vercel Build Fix Summary

## Problem
The Vercel build was failing due to dependency conflicts between React 19.1.0 and packages that only supported older React versions:
- `react-spring@9.7.3` only supported React `^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0`
- `framer-motion@11.0.3` only supported React `^18.0.0`

## Solution
1. **Removed unused dependencies**: Both `react-spring` and `framer-motion` were not actually used in the codebase, so they were removed from `package.json`

2. **Added `.npmrc` files**: Created `.npmrc` files in both root and frontend directories with:
   ```
   legacy-peer-deps=true
   auto-install-peers=true
   ```

3. **Updated package.json scripts**: Modified the build script to use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag:
   ```json
   "install:frontend": "cd frontend && npm install --legacy-peer-deps",
   "build": "npm run install:frontend && cd frontend && npm run build"
   ```

4. **Created vercel.json**: Added Vercel configuration file for proper deployment:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "buildCommand": "npm run build",
     "outputDirectory": "frontend/build",
     "installCommand": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps",
     "framework": "create-react-app"
   }
   ```

## Testing
- ✅ Local `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` works without errors
- ✅ Local `npm run build` completes successfully
- ✅ Build produces optimized production files in `frontend/build`

## Files Modified
- `/frontend/package.json` - Removed unused dependencies
- `/package.json` - Updated build scripts
- `/.npmrc` - Added npm configuration
- `/frontend/.npmrc` - Added npm configuration  
- `/vercel.json` - Added Vercel deployment configuration

The build should now work on Vercel without the ERESOLVE dependency conflicts.
